# Hi, I'm Mustafa Scentwala :wave:

MSc in Artificial Intelligence (Merit) focused on practical machine learning and analytics.  
I like turning raw data into clear answers and simple tools people can use.

- :rocket: Looking for junior roles: Data Scientist, Data Analyst, AI/Data Consultant
- :seedling: Currently sharpening: SQL (joins, windows, CTEs), Power BI & DAX, model evaluation
- :handshake: Open to collaborate on real-world ML/analytics projects

## Skills
**Python:** pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Jupyter  
**ML:** classification & regression, model evaluation (precision, recall, F1, ROC-AUC), cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost  
**Data:** cleaning, feature engineering, encoding, SMOTE, outlier handling  
**BI & Viz:** Power BI, Excel basics  
**Bonus:** Webots, PID control, Kalman filtering (UAV project)

## Projects
- **Fraud Detection POC**  
  End-to-end pipeline on a large transaction dataset; compared multiple models and selected XGBoost.  
  Focus on precision/recall trade-offs and a simple batch-scoring script.  
  Repo: https://github.com/MustafaScentwala72/Fraud-Detection-Model

- **Accident Severity Prediction**  
  Supervised classification to predict accident severity from road, environment, and traffic features.  
  Built a clean preprocessing pipeline, tuned models, and reported class-wise metrics with emphasis on recall for severe cases.

- **MLP Learning-Rate Tuning (Nonlinear Regression)**  
  Single-hidden-layer MLP with a small learning-rate sweep; chosen rate balanced speed and generalisation.  
  Reported R2 on test with a stable generalisation gap.

- **UAV Waypoint Navigation (Webots)**  
  Decentralised control for 4 drones forming shapes; PID + Kalman filter for smooth flight.

## How I work
- Start simple. Baselines first, then iterate.
- Measure what matters. Pick metrics that match the goal (and explain them in plain English).
- Keep it reproducible. Clean notebooks, clear READMEs, minimal dependencies.
